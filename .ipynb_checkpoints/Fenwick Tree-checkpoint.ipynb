    "The idea is based on the fact that all positive integers can be represented as the sum of powers of 2. For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every node of the BITree stores the sum of n elements where n is a power of 2. For example, the sum of the first 12 elements can be obtained by the sum of the last 4 elements (from 9 to 12) plus the sum of 8 elements (from 1 to 8). The number of set bits in the binary representation of a number n is O(Logn). Therefore, we traverse at-most O(Logn) nodes in both getSum() and update() operations. The time complexity of the construction is O(nLogn) as it calls update() for all n elements. "
